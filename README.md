# ACM@BU Algorithms Practice

This is the repo containing solutions and problem information for the ACM Chapter at Baylor University's algorithms meeting. We typically do 1-3 leetcode problems.

# Repository
Each meeting has the problems for that meeting in a markdown file at `meetings/{date}`. If you solve the problem, please add your solution into the directory `solutions/{problem}/{username}`.

# Resources
This stuff is hard. If you'd like to get better at it, I'd recommend:
